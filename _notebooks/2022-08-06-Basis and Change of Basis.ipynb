    "`NOTE:` Change of basis vs linear transformation The difference between change of basis and linear transformation is conceptual. Sometimes it is useful to consider the effect of a matrix as a change of basis; sometimes you get more insights when you think of it as a linear transformation. Either you move the vector or you move its reference. This is why rotating the coordinate system has an inverse effect compared to rotating the vector itself. For eigendecomposition and SVD, both of these views are usually taken together, which can be confusing at first. Keeping this difference in mind will be useful throughout the end of the book. The main technical difference between the two is that change of basis must be invertible, which is not required for linear transformations."
